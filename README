Tentative Processing support for libpd

This revision is brand new and largely untested, and the included binaries are
currently for Mac OS only (we're hoping to fix that soon); proceed at your own
risk.

The directory PureDataP5 contains the source code and dependencies, configured
for development on Mac OS. You won't need to look at this unless you want to
participate in the development of this library.

If you just want to use libpd with Processing, then you can unpack the file
pdp5.zip into the libraries folder of Processing. On my Mac, that folder is
Documents/Processing/libraries.
